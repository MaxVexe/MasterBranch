# Rate My Course
A web application designed specifically for Montclair State University Students to freely review and rate courses he or she has taken. 
## Changes
Since we have split the group into two pairs, each pair working on the frontend or the backend, we are able to efficiently and effectively complete the project.
** Frontend **
Below is a list of tasks that we have created to use a guideline so far:
- [X] Rate My Course Logo
- [X] Homepage
- [X] Registration Page
- [] Registration Page for Users Only
- [] Registration Page for Admin Only
- [X] Login Page
- [] View Account Page
- [] Search Page

The changes we recently made were creating a folder and uploading a revised version of a code to a folder already created. The templates folder was already created specifically for HTML, and although we could have added the images to this folder since the images will be used in the HTML code. We decided it would be best to have a separate folder called “Images” for clarity and organization purposes. This will allow us (frontend and backend) to easily navigate between the folders to change, add, or delete images for the project and implement them where needed. We uploaded a revised code for the homepage in the “templates” folder. The new changes in the code are the added image of the final logo and fixing the format of the homepage.
