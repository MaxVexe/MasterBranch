# Rate My Course
A web application designed specifically for Montclair State University Students to freely review and rate courses he or she has taken. 
## Changes
Since we have split the group into two pairs, each pair working on the frontend or the backend, we are able to efficiently and effectively complete the project.
Below is a list of tasks that we have created to use a guideline:
- [] Rate My Course Logo
- [] Homepage
- [] Registration Page
- [] Registration Page for Users
- [] Registration Page for Admin
- [] Login Page
- [] Account Page
- [] Search Page
